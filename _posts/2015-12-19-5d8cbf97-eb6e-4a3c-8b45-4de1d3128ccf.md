The amount of research I've done, well, I don't understand the idea of "investing." I also hate the term "trading." Check out today at about 24 minutes in...That was my question to BAT.
If I sell a put in DIS, is that a trade or an investment? I think there needs to be a new term for this. 
I'm thinking something like "capital management."
So, hence forth, the new website will be "LP Capital Management".
Peace.
